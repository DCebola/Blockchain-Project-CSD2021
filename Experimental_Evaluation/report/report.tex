% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:

% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.

% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need

	%(defining the problem, goals/objectives and initial presentation of the solution as a way to address the problem). Finish this with a summary of the organization of the remaining

	\IEEEPARstart{T}{}his work was proposed by professor Henrique Domingos as the course project of “Dependable Distributed Systems“ 2020-21.

	From cloud and world-wide e-commerce platforms to banking replacements, distributed systems are widely used nowadays for various tasks.
	Such tasks can range from simple consultations (e.g. querying products available in an online store) to critical operations (e.g. money transfers). Frequently these operations need to be ordered and the processes involved are required to reach an agreement. To solve this problem distributed systems often rely on state machine replication and a consensus algorithm.

	With the increasing number of distributed systems being used for critical tasks, it is imperative that they are dependable and ensure high degree of reliability, availability, safety, confidentiality, fault tolerance, integrity and maintainability. When designing dependable systems it is necessary to consider the execution environment and the correct adversary model.
	
	Inspired by the rise of blockchain technologies and the way such technologies deal with consensus, in the realm of financial operations, we will present the implementation of a dependable decentralized ledger for a blockchained global wallet service. From this point onwards we will refer to the system using BGWS.
	BGWS will operate in an asynchronous environment, with no timing assumptions, over authenticated channels and consider byzantine faults. 

	We will study how the number of replicas impact the overall performance of the system, how the size of blocks affect the latency of successful mining operations and how the system tolerates faults.
		
	The remaining of the document is organized as follows.
	In Section 2, we introduce important concepts related to our work, more specifically Byzantine Fault Tolerance and the Blockchain technology.
	In Section 3, we present BGWS system model and architecture.
	Internal mechanisms, design assumptions and the service planes are covered in section 4.
	In Section 5, we explain the technology stack used and development issues.
	Section 6 will present the experimental setting and discussion of the obtained results.
	In Section 7 we evaluate the current state of the BGWS system, its correctness, limitations and trade-offs.
	Finally, in Section 7 we conclude the document and mention future work.
	



	\section{Background}
	\subsection{State Machine Replication}
	We can define a state machine as a set of states, a set of transitions, and a current state. When a user issues an operation to the machine, that operation triggers a transition from its current state to a new one, producing an output. 

	In State Machine Replication, multiple replicas of a system are created, each one being a deterministic state machine. If they are given an input of the same operations in the same order, all the replicas will transition to the same state and produce the same output. The ordering of the operations will have to be decided through an agreement protocol. 

	\subsection{Consensus}
	Consensus algorithms are used by processes to reach agreement. There are various forms of consensus and algorithms that solve them\cite{lamport2001paxos}\cite{raft}. From binary consensus, multi-valued consensus, to probabilistic consensus that relies on randomization algorithms\cite{moniz2008ritas}\cite{moniz2006experimental}. Let us consider the following specification of consensus: 

	\begin{description}
		\item \textbf{C1 (Termination)}: Every correct process eventually decides a value.
		\item \textbf{C2 (Validity)}: If a process decides v, then v was proposed by some process.
		\item \textbf{C3 (Integrity)}: No process decides twice.
		\item \textbf{C4 (Agreement)}: No two correct processes decide differently.
	\end{description}

	In an environment with byzantine such specification is not enough. Byzantine processes can have an unpredictable and arbitrary behavior, so we need to restrict all properties to correct processes and the validity property must require that every value decided by a correct process must have been proposed by some process.
	We also need to adopt the notion of \textit{weak} and \textit{strong} validity, respectively, for execution scenarios where all processes are correct and execution scenarios where there are byzantine processes. 
	
	In byzantine consensus values can not be invented arbitrarily and must have been proposed by a correct process. In  \textit{strong} validity, if there is no agreement in the decided value, an arbitrary $\bot$ is decided, that symbolizes “not decided”.

	To implement byzantine consensus in practice, the PBFT\cite{castro1999practical} algorithm uses public-key cryptography, and digital signatures. The system needs quorums (majorities) of $3n+1$ nodes to tolerate $n$ faults.
